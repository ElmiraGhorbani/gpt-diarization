    "# Conversational Speaker Diarization\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is centered around harnessing the capabilities of advanced AI language models (specifically, gpt-4) to conduct speaker diarization on conversation transcripts, which are sourced from the OpenAI Whisper API. Speaker diarization involves segmenting spoken content into distinct portions belonging to different speakers. This approach simplifies the analysis of conversations by providing clear, structured outputs that highlight the interactions among various speakers."
